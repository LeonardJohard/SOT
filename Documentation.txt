SOM DTW for trajectory variance analysis

Takes a set of n-dimensional trajectories and produces a  piecwise linear 'mean' trajectory. Calculates intrastroke variance around each linesegment.

Standard SOM can be viewed as a 2-step process:
1. Assign each point to the closest node
2. Adapt position of closest node and its neighbors towards the mean of the assigned points

SOM DTW works on a set of points as follows:
1. Calculate for each trajectory (a set of consecutive points) the closest DTW mapping to the saved SOM trajectory (a set of consecutive nodes).
2. Assign each point to the corresponding node of the DTW mapping.
3. As 2 above

SOMDTW is a restriction of the regular SOM point to keep the consecutive order of the point-to-node mapping.


Usage: Add() all trajectories, then run adapt() and adaptDTW() until
convergence. Get variance from segvar estimate or run fullmean for
complete analysis.
